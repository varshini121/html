      Food is what we eat to stay strong and healthy. It comes in many different
      types such as<q>fruits like apples and bananas</q> vegetables like carrots
      and peas, grains like rice and wheat, and proteins like meat and beans. We
      also have yummy treats like cookies and ice cream, but we should only eat
      them sometimes because they have a lot of sugar. Our bodies need a mix of
      all these food types to grow and play. So, itâ€™s important to eat a variety
      of foods every day. Eating a rainbow of food colors can make meal times
      fun and healthy! -->

    <p>Information about the Pizza</p>
    <blockquote title="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Pizza">
      Today, pizza is a symbol of several cultures: Italians, particularly from
      Naples, are proud of authentic pizza made with local ingredients and
      following strict guidelines for preparation. In the United States, pizza
      has iconic status as a typical American food, quickly prepared and readily
      available, and enjoyed by people of all ages at social occasions as well
      as family meals. The different styles, from places such as New York City
      and Chicago, reflect the diversity of American culture. Countries
      throughout the world have adopted pizza as a favorite food, adding their
      own variations to make this dish their own.
