<h1>India’s stand on Israel’s war against Palestine flayed</h1>
<strong>Condemning India’s stand on Israel’s attack on Palestine, members of Tamil Nadu Association for Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Caregivers (TARATDAC) staged a protest here on Wednesday</strong>
<p>Its district president <em>Veeramani</em> said that more than <u>8,000</u> people, including 4,000 children, had been killed in the attack, and more than 20,000 people admitted t hospitals with serious injuries. While Palestine already had around 93,000 differently abled people, those who were seriously injuried would be left to spend <de>their remaining</del>life with disabilities.</p>

<p>Violence in Israel and Palestine has a way of commanding attention in the United States. On Wednesday morning, Joe Biden’s call for a “significant de-escalation” in the conflict adorned the front pages of the Washington Post and New York Times. On American social media, running arguments between Likudnik and pro-Palestinian forces fill the gaps between debates over mask etiquette and Demi Lovato’s nonbinary identity.The basic story is that people talk a lot about Israel/Palestine because a lot of other people are talking about it. Making a public statement about Israel says something about you. Indeed, it’s so widely discussed that a huge range of different nuances is legible. Bernie Sanders’ comments are very critical of Israel, but he also affirms that “Israel has the absolute right to live in peace and security,” thus separating <del>himself from</del> the most critical voices.</p>
