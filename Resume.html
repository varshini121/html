                       CARP:developed a new password scheme that uses a combination offactors to create more complex and difficult-to-crack
                            passwords. The scheme also includes a built-in passwordmanager. The new scheme has been tested and proven to be
                            more secure than traditional password schemes. I am proud ofmy work on this project
